1. Download all the files and folders
2. Copy all the 3 icons from Icons folder into /usr/share/icons/ of your system
3. Run service.py first and open a new tab then run tray.py.

This is for testing purpose only

1. Copy service.py, tray.py and Gilly.py into /usr/bin
2. Now add service.py and tray.py to list of system-startup applications in ubuntu, so it will start whenever you start your system

Note:- Planning to create a deb package, and to bring this into Ubuntu software center, so that it would available to all Ubuntu users and to make installation with one click :)

service.py will fetch 2 to 4 kb data from Internet every 60 seconds, I hope that wouldn't cost you much.
On further updates to the app, users can able to set time for auto-refresh from 60 seconds to whatever time you wish.
